#Vehicle Price Prediction & Type Classification

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Classifier, PostgreSQL, Jupyter Notebook

**Overview:**
A machine learning project that predicts the price of a vehicle and determines whether it’s a Car, Bike, or Scooty based on features such as brand, model, transmission type, fuel type, fuel tank capacity, and mileage.

**Key Features:
**
**Database Integration:** PostgreSQL connected with Jupyter Notebook for dataset management.

**Price Prediction: **GradientBoostingRegressor for continuous price prediction.

**Type Classification: **RandomForestClassifier for multi-class classification.

**Interactive Input:** Takes vehicle name as input and outputs predicted price & type.

**ML Workflow:** Data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and tuning.

**Dummy Dataset:** Simulates real-world vehicle data for training/testing.

**Example:**

Input: "Honda Activa 6G"

Output: Predicted Price: ₹80,000 | Predicted Type: Scooty
